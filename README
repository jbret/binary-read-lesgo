These MATLAB scripts and functions will read lesgo's binary output data into MATLAB so that they can be post-processed.

USAGE:
- Copy all the MATLAB scripts/functions into the directory where you ran your simulation.
- This should be the same directory level where lesgo_param.out is located.
- The script will read lesgo_param.out to get the simulation parameters.
- The script assumes the other data (statistics, snapshots, etc.) are stored in ./output.

FEATURES:
As of 31 Mar 2016, the scripts can read average velocities, Reynolds stresses, and instantaneous velocity snapshots.

TESTING:
Successfully testing on the following MATLAB versions:
- R2011b, R2013b

CONTRIBUTING:
If you would like to contribute to this MATLAB project (fix bugs, add features, etc.) then please fork the project at:
https://github.com/jbret/binary-read-lesgo.git

Snapshots will be taken from the above repo at regular intervals and will be packaged with the lesgo code base.
